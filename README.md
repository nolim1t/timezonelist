Timezone List Object
=============

Why?
-------------
Currently theres no way (not that I know of anyway) to convert
a string date time + string timezone into a timestamp.

And I wish to change that now.

What
-------------
This is a class which has most of the world timezones for use with
a future library to be developed.

Pre-requisites
-------------
- Coffeescript

Usage
-------------
1. Download this repo
2. Copy directory to node_modules
3. Prepend **timezoneoffsets = require "timezonelist"** to the file you wish to use

Todo
-------------
- Make NPM package
- Add coffeescript to dependencies
 

Licensing
-------------
Without going on about pages of pointless text, I do ask that you
fork this project is you are going to use it - that way you can add
any changes as a pull request therefore benefitting everyone.

Sharing is caring right?
